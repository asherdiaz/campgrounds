# campgrounds
I created a Java application which allows users to search a selection of National Parks. 

Users can find more information about each park, including a short description, a list of campgrounds, and park history. Users can also make a new reservation or search for an existing reservations for a campground within each park. 

This program was completed with a partner as one of our capstone projects for Tech Elevator, an intensive 14-week coding bootcamp. The Campgrounds application was one of the first applications I created halfway through the course as part of the learning process. 

This application is command line driven. To run, click CampgroundCLI.java.
